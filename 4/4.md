# Divide it!

## Description
You are given an integer `n`. You can perform any of the following operations with this number an arbitrary (possibly, zero) number of times:

1. Replace `n` with `n/2` if `n` is divisible by `2`
2. Replace `n` with `2n/3` if `n` is divisible by `3`
3. Replace `n` with `4n/5` if `n` is divisible by `5`

For example, you can replace `30` with `15` using the first operation, with `20` using the second operation or with `24` using the third operation.

Your task is to find the minimum number of moves required to obtain `1` from `n` or say that it is impossible to do it.

## Input
The input contains one integer `n` ($1 \le n \le 10^{18}$).

## Output
Print the answer for the query. If it is impossible to obtain 1 from `n`, print `-1`. Otherwise, print the minimum number of moves required to do it.
