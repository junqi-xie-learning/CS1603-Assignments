# 简易工资管理系统

## Description
为某公司建立工资管理系统，该公司具有以下四类人员：

1. `salaried employee`：每周固定工资
2. `hourly employee`：按小时付工资，一周工作量超过 40 小时者超过部分双倍计发工资
3. `commission employee`：按销售金额根据一定百分比提成
4. `base-salary-plus-commission employee`：是 3 的特殊情况，有基本工资

其中，每个人员具有姓名，身份证号，相应计算工资所需数据。使用抽象类、多态性概念，编写演示程序输出每个人姓名和应发工资。

## Samples
### Sample Input 1 
```
// create derived-class objects
SalariedEmployee salariedEmployee{ "John", "Smith", "111-11-1111", 800 };
HourlyEmployee hourlyEmployee{ "Karen", "Price", "222-22-2222", 16.75, 40 };
CommissionEmployee commissionEmployee{ "Sue", "Jones", "333-33-3333", 10000, .06 };
BasePlusCommissionEmployee basePlusCommissionEmployee{ "Bob", "Lewis", "444-44-4444", 5000, .04, 300 };

cout << "Employees processed individually using static binding:\n\n";

// output each Employee's information and earnings using static binding
salariedEmployee.print();
cout << "\nearned $" << salariedEmployee.earnings() << "\n\n";
hourlyEmployee.print();
cout << "\nearned $" << hourlyEmployee.earnings() << "\n\n";
commissionEmployee.print();
cout << "\nearned $" << commissionEmployee.earnings() << "\n\n";
basePlusCommissionEmployee.print();
cout << "\nearned $" << basePlusCommissionEmployee.earnings() << "\n\n";

// create array of four base-class pointers
Employee * employees[4];

// initialize array with Employees
employees[0] = &salariedEmployee;
employees[1] = &hourlyEmployee;
employees[2] = &commissionEmployee;
employees[3] = &basePlusCommissionEmployee;

cout << "Employees processed polymorphically via dynamic binding:\n\n";

// call virtualViaPointer to print each Employee's information
// and earnings using dynamic binding
cout << "Virtual function calls made off base-class pointers:\n\n";

for (int i = 0; i < 4; i++)
    virtualViaPointer(employees[i]);

// call virtualViaReference to print each Employee's information
// and earnings using dynamic binding
cout << "Virtual function calls made off base-class references:\n\n";

for (int i = 0; i < 4; i++)
    virtualViaReference(*employees[i]); // note dereferencing
```
